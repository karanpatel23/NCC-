# CLAUDE.md — nccinfraspace.com rebuild

## What this repo is

A from-scratch rebuild of **https://nccinfraspace.com/**, the website of NCC Infraspace
Pvt Ltd (trading tagline: "Nataraj Construction Company").

There is **no access** to the original Git repository, source code, design files, CMS,
database, or developer documentation. The live public website is the only source of
truth about what currently exists.

## Current phase

**PHASE 1 — FORENSIC EXTRACTION.** Not rebuilding yet.

| Phase | Status | Gate to advance |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Remote recon | ✅ Complete | `docs/00-phase0-forensic-report.md` |
| 1 — Browser extraction | 🔄 In progress | `forensics/out/HANDOFF-INPUT.md` exists and is populated |
| 2 — Full forensic report | ⬜ Blocked on 1 | `docs/02-reconstruction-handoff.md` written |
| 3 — Requirements | ⬜ Blocked on 2 | `docs/01-requirements.md` written by the repo owner |
| 4 — Rebuild | ⬜ Blocked on 3 | — |

### Hard rule
**Do not write any code under `site/` until phase 3 is complete.** The owner has not yet
specified what to preserve, what to remove, what to redesign, which stack to use, or what
functionality to add. Building before that produces work that gets thrown away.

If asked to "start building" while phases 1–3 are incomplete, say so and point at the gate.

## Directory contract

- `forensics/` — **write once, never edit.** This is evidence. If a crawl needs redoing,
  re-run the crawler and let it overwrite its own output; never hand-edit files in
  `forensics/out/`. Do not delete `forensics/out/` to "clean up" — it is the only record
  of a site that cannot be read without a browser.
- `docs/` — analysis and specifications. Append and revise freely.
- `site/` — the rebuild. Empty until phase 4.

## Critical technical context

The existing site is a **client-rendered Create React App SPA with no server-side
rendering**. Every route returns an identical ~1 KB shell:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
```

Consequences:
- `curl`, `fetch`, `wget`, and any non-browser HTTP tool will return **nothing useful**.
  Do not attempt to analyse the site that way and do not report the empty shell as a finding.
- All extraction must go through a real browser. That is what `forensics/forensic-crawl.mjs`
  (Playwright + Chromium) exists for.
- Per-route `<title>` is set client-side, so route titles only appear after JS executes.
- Only `/` and `/contact` are confirmed to exist. The full route table lives inside
  `forensics/out/raw/main.*.js` and in the crawl output.

## How to run the extraction

```bash
cd forensics
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
node forensic-crawl.mjs https://nccinfraspace.com/
```

Output lands in `forensics/out/`. The file to read first is `out/HANDOFF-INPUT.md`.
Screenshots at `out/shots/*.{1440,834,390}.png` carry the visual design information —
they need to be looked at, not just listed.

## Known issues with the existing site (carry into requirements)

1. **SEO is critically broken.** No server-rendered content; only two URLs indexed
   anywhere; one shared meta description sitewide; no discoverable sitemap. Any rebuild
   should treat SSR/SSG, per-route metadata, an XML sitemap, and structured data as
   non-negotiable.
2. Contact email of record is a Yahoo address, not a domain address.
3. The 1987 heritage (originally the partnership firm Natraj Construction Company) is
   reduced to a meta description tagline.
4. Brand name collides in search with NCC Limited (Nagarjuna) and NCC AB (Sweden).

## Company facts (verified off-site — MCA, Crisil, D&B)

Treat these as background. **Where the live site's own copy differs, the site wins** —
it is the artifact being reconstructed.

- Legal name: NCC Infraspace Private Limited. CIN U45200GJ2015PTC082845.

  private limited company 09-Apr-2015.
- Civil and infrastructure construction, primarily **roads and bridges**.
- Class AA contractor registered with the Government of Gujarat.
- Customers are predominantly **government agencies** — the site's job is credibility,
  credentials, and recruitment, not commercial lead generation.

  — unresolved, needs owner confirmation.

## Related work

The repo owner is separately building a construction management software system for the
same client. That is a **different project** — do not merge concerns, share code, or
assume the website should surface data from it unless explicitly instructed.

## Working style

- Confidence labels in all analysis: **Confirmed** / **High-confidence inference** /
  **Possible** / **Unknown**. Never present inference as fact.
- If something cannot be determined from available evidence, write
  "Unknown — cannot be determined" rather than filling the gap.
- Prefer reusable components over per-page hard-coding in any eventual rebuild.
